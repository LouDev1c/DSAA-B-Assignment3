In the darkness where shadows expand,
I search for a light to guide me, hand in hand.
But deep within, a spark ignites,
Carrying me through the night, without losing sight.

(Pre-Chorus)
When the world around me fades away,
It's the light within that keeps me from fray.
With every breath and every step I take,
I grow stronger, for the light within is my break.

(Chorus)
A light in the darkness, shining bright,
Showing me the way out of this deep plight.
In my eyes, hope gleams so clear,
The light in the darkness, always near.

(Verse 2)
On darkened streets that seem to stretch afar,
I find the courage to defend who we are.
For as I penetrate the depths of night,
I discover beauty that surrounds, and I take flight.

(Bridge)
The night may be daunting, it's true,
But the light in the darkness won't leave me askew.
It illuminates my soul, strengthens my mind,
In this darkness, I find peace, my song to unwind.

(Chorus)
A light in the darkness, shining bright,
Showing me the way out of this deep plight.
In my eyes, hope gleams so clear,
The light in the darkness, always near.
